## Customer Segmentation (Classification Analysis)

### Description:

This project revolves around customer segmentation and classification using supervised learning techniques. The primary objective is to categorize customers based on their behavior and preferences. The classification models employed for this analysis include Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest.

### Customer Segmentation:

The initial phase involves segmenting customers to better understand their characteristics and tailor marketing strategies accordingly.

### Classification Models:

The core focus of this project is on supervised learning classification models. The following algorithms are implemented and compared:

1. Naive Bayes:
Utilizes Bayes' theorem with the "naive" assumption of independence between features.

2. Logistic Regression:
Applies logistic function to model binary classification problems.

3. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):
Classifies data points based on the majority class of their k-nearest neighbors.

4. Decision Tree:
Constructs a tree-like model for decisions based on feature values.

5. Random Forest:
Ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy and robustness.

### Evaluation and Comparison:

The performance of each classification model is thoroughly evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision and error rate. A comparative analysis provides insights into the strengths and weaknesses of each algorithm in the context of customer segmentation.

## Contributions and Feedback:

Contributions, bug reports, and feedback are highly encouraged. Feel free to submit issues or pull requests to enhance the functionality and performance of the classification models.
